## SnakeCharmR

Modern overhaul of `rPython`.

You need a compiler and also these caveats:

### LINUX AND UNIX-LIKE SYSTEMS

Package SnakeCharmR depends on Python (>= 2.7).

It requires both Python and its headers and libraries. These can be found in python and
python-dev packages in Debian-like Linux distributions.

In systems where several Python versions coexist, the user can choose the Python version
to use at installation time. By default, the package will be installed using the Python
version given by

    $ python --version

<<<<<<< HEAD
but it is possible to select a different one if the SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION environment 
=======
but it is possible to select a different one if the RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION environment 
>>>>>>> master
variable is appropriately set.

For instance, if it is defined as

<<<<<<< HEAD
    SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION=3.2
=======
    RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION=3.2
>>>>>>> master

it will try to use Python 3.2 (looking for python3.2 and python3.2-config in the path). If
set to

<<<<<<< HEAD
    SNAKECHARMR_PYTHON_VERSION=3
=======
    RPYTHON_PYTHON_VERSION=3
>>>>>>> master

it will install against the "canonical" Python version in the system within the 3.x branch.


### WINDOWS SYSTEMS

<<<<<<< HEAD
There wasn't much testing done on Windows systems at this point, any help in testing and
maintaining that would be much appreciated.
=======
On a Windows system, the package can be installed from <https://github.com/cjgb/rPython-win>. 
It is the same source code and comes with specific platform instructions.
>>>>>>> master
