# SnakeCharmR 1.0.2

Fixed linking and building errors on some platforms (such as Amazon Linux) by updating the
autoconf file to use the correct C++ compiler preferred by R.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.1

Fixed handling of NULL values in arguments, including a workaround for jeroenooms/jsonlite#130 which was causing inconsistencies.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.0

Initial release.
