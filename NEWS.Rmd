# SnakeCharmR 1.0.4

Fixes https://github.com/asieira/SnakeCharmR/issues/24. Thanks for David Severski (@dseverski)
for reporting this.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.3

Taking measures to ensure SnakeCharmR will work properly on systems where the native encoding is not UTF-8:

* Using Python API to check if variable is str/bytes or unicode and handling things correctly. In particular, when we read Python unicode values we flag the resulting R string as UTF-8 since thatâ€™s what we Python C API we are using will return;

* Ensuring that Python code being executed is converted to UTF-8 and that the Python interpreter is made aware of that according to PEP 263.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.2

Fixed linking and building errors on some platforms (such as Amazon Linux) by updating the
autoconf file to use the correct C++ compiler preferred by R.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.1

Fixed handling of NULL values in arguments, including a workaround for jeroenooms/jsonlite#130 which was causing inconsistencies.

# SnakeCharmR 1.0.0

Initial release.
